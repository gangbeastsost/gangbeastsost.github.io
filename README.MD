# Gang Beasts OST Player
A fast, intuitive, and responsive website to listen to the Gang Beasts OST with ease. Created using GitHub Copilot. Please don't kill me. I don't use AI for everything. I am not like the big tech corporations that worship AI. The code is probably a spaghetti tangled mess, but as long as it works, then I'm happy. I do not believe AI should be used to create things with mass amounts of complexity ~~cough cough microsoft~~. I have massive amounts of respect for real coders and web designers. Don't take this as a stab in the back.
